## [Unreleased]

**Living Wiki cold-start reliability campaign** (2026-05-02 outage remediation). On
2026-05-02 a Living Wiki cold-start on a default Ollama install produced 12 pages that
were all rejected by quality gates, with no per-page progress signal, broken retry-resume,
and a pod restart that killed the job mid-flight. Seven tickets fixed the structural causes:
CA-150 (tier-aware quality gates so local models pass), CA-145 + CA-143 (progress counter
and retry-resume now agree on durable state), CA-142 (graceful drain protects in-flight
jobs from Argo Image Updater rollouts), CA-141 (heartbeat-stale reaper detects stuck jobs
in ~5 min instead of ~32 min), CA-144 (per-page in-flight visibility in admin Monitor),
CA-146 (page-count transparency and per-run override).

### Added

- **Graceful drain for in-flight Living Wiki cold-starts** (CA-142).
  SIGTERM no longer races with the reaper to kill long-running Living Wiki
  jobs. `BeginDrain` now sets `o.draining = true` on the LLM orchestrator so
  `reapStaleJobs` skips `StatusGenerating` jobs for the full drain window (up
  to `SOURCEBRIDGE_SHUTDOWN_GRACE_SECONDS`, default 3600s). A public
  `MarkDraining(bool)` method is exposed for testing. A 5 s K8s endpoint
  propagation settle delay is inserted between `BeginDrain` and `AwaitDrain`.
  Seven structured log events added (`server_drain_handler_armed`,
  `drain_await_begin`, `drain_progress`, `drain_workers_wait_complete`,
  `http_shutdown_complete`, `received_sigterm`, `reaper_skipped_during_drain`).
  Worker Helm template gains a `startupProbe` matching the kustomize base.
  See `docs/admin/api-drain.md` for operator runbook.

- **Per-run page count override for Living Wiki cold-starts** (CA-146).
  New optional `pageCountOverride: Int` field on `enableLivingWikiForRepo`
  and `retryLivingWikiJob` lets operators cap the number of pages generated
  for a single run without changing the persisted `MaxPagesPerJob` setting.
  Valid range 1–500. The UI surfaces this as a collapsible "Run options"
  section inline with the Build Overview / Build Detailed buttons. The cap
  is skipped on targeted-retry paths (`retryExcludedOnly: true`) so
  explicitly-named pages are never silently discarded. A structured planning
  log line (`livingwiki/coldstart: planned page count`) is now emitted at
  the start of every run stating the page breakdown and applied cap.

- **Auto-version-bump-on-merge via release-please** (`e02fd92`, CA-147).
  Adopted [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) to
  automate version bumping and changelog generation. Conventional-commit PRs
  to main now drive an always-current Release PR; merging it cuts the next
  tag, which fires `oss-release.yml` (when `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` is
  provisioned) for the existing binary build / Docker image / cosign /
  Homebrew tap pipeline. Manifest-MINIMAL: tracks only the canonical release
  surfaces — git tags (root, `release-type: go`) and
  `plugins/vscode/package.json` (separate VSCode-marketplace cadence,
  tagged as `sourcebridge-vscode-vX.Y.Z`). The web bundle, Python worker,
  and example app are decorative — explicitly NOT bumped to avoid churn.
  CHANGELOG storytelling preserved as much as possible via
  `changelog-sections` config (Keep-a-Changelog mapping). `oss-release.yml`
  patched to set `generate_release_notes: false` so release-please owns
  release-note text. Both tag-triggered workflows tightened to SemVer-shaped
  globs to avoid plugin-tag collisions. RELEASING.md fully rewritten;
  CONTRIBUTING.md gains a "Commit messages" section explaining conventional
  commits. Token provisioning (GH App preferred) tracked in CA-149 — until
  that lands, every release-please-merged tag requires a manual re-push to
  fire downstream workflows. RELEASING.md documents the manual unblock.

- **Per-page in-flight visibility for Living Wiki cold-starts** (CA-144).
  Operators can now see which pages are mid-generation in the admin Monitor
  when a Living Wiki cold-start is running. New REST endpoint
  `GET /api/v1/admin/llm/jobs/{id}/livingwiki/in-flight` returns sorted
  in-flight pages with elapsed time and a stuck-page warn-dot (yellow dot
  when elapsed exceeds 3× the run's median, or 300s flat before 3
  completions). Structured `slog` events (`page generation started`,
  `page generation retrying`, `page generation finished`) carry `job_id`,
  `page_id`, `template_id`, and `duration_ms` for headless operators using
  log aggregation. The in-flight panel mounts under the expanded job row in
  the Monitor UI for all running `living_wiki` jobs, polled every 2s.

- **GraphQL `VersionInfo` reaches API parity with REST `/api/v1/version`**
  (`aeb92d8`, CA-138). The `VersionInfo` type now exposes all 7 fields
  the REST endpoint reports: `version`, `commit`, `buildDate`, `goVersion`,
  `edition`, `buildEdition`, `workerVersion`. Identical cached worker-version
  lookup is shared between REST and GraphQL via a new `Resolver.WorkerVersion`
  function-shaped DI wired from `rest.NewServer`. A new parity test in
  `internal/api/rest/graphql_version_parity_test.go` asserts both surfaces
  return field-for-field identical responses for every config shape.

### Changed

- **`MaxPagesPerJob` default raised from 50 to 500, and is now wired as a real
  cap** (CA-146). Previously, `MaxPagesPerJob` was stored in the database and
  surfaced in the Settings UI but was never applied to cold-start jobs —
  effectively a placebo. It is now wired into `buildColdStartRunner` and
  applied after taxonomy resolution on every cold-start. The default is raised
  from 50 to 500 so that existing repos with the never-touched default do not
  experience silent truncation after upgrading. Repos whose `MaxPagesPerJob`
  was exactly 50 (the prior default) are automatically migrated to 500 by
  migration `055_lw_max_pages_default_500.surql`. Operators who deliberately
  set a value other than 50 retain their custom value. The planning log line
  now records `cap_source=repo_setting` when this cap fires.

### Fixed

- **discuss / Q&A**: When `discussCode` is anchored on a symbol, the LLM prompt now
  includes the symbol's actual implementation source sliced from the file by line range,
  instead of relying on metadata plus a whole-file dump. Token cost on long files is
  meaningfully reduced and answer quality on symbol-scoped discuss threads improves.
  (CA-107)

- **`OnPageDone` now fires after persistence** (`1317cec`+`c597468`, CA-145, CA-143). Progress
  counter and smart-resume now agree on which pages are durably stored.
  Previously, `OnPageDone` fired before the post-Wait persistence loop, so
  the in-memory completion set could exceed the persisted set; on
  interruption and retry, smart-resume saw a smaller persisted set than
  progress had reported, leading to apparent regressions and
  double-generation of pages the user saw counted. Phase 1 (`1317cec`)
  moved the callsite; Phase 2 adds three orchestrator tests
  (`TestRetryResume_ProgressMatchesPersistedSet_PR`,
  `TestRetryResume_ProgressMatchesPersistedSet_DirectPublish`,
  `TestRetryResume_NoProgressOnHardError`) and one cold-start runner test
  (`TestRetryResume_SmartResumeMatchesProgress`) locking the contract.

- **Stale-job reaper detects stuck Living Wiki jobs in ~5 min instead of ~32 min**
  (`1b61436`+`d21d373`, CA-141). The reaper tick is dropped from 60 s to 15 s, and a
  heartbeat-stale threshold (5 min since last heartbeat) is applied specifically to
  `living_wiki` jobs, which already emit a heartbeat every 30 s. Previously, the
  reaper used a flat 30-minute wall-clock threshold and a 60-second tick, so a wedged
  cold-start was not reaped until `30 min + ≤60 s ≈ 32 min` after it stalled. Healthy
  long-running jobs are unaffected: they heartbeat continuously, so the 5-minute
  heartbeat-stale window never fires on a running job. Other subsystems that do not
  emit heartbeats retain the existing 30-minute threshold. Composed with CA-142's drain
  guard: the faster reaper does not race with graceful shutdown because CA-142's
  `o.draining` check fires first.

- **Quality gates no longer reject all local-LLM Living Wiki output**
  (`c0a7bbb`–`41c0d5a`, reconcile `3145077`, CA-150). Living Wiki generation
  now calibrates quality-gate thresholds against the LLM's capability tier
  (`frontier` / `mid` / `local`). Local models served via Ollama or other
  open-weight providers previously hit frontier citation-density and vagueness
  gates they structurally cannot satisfy, producing 100% exclusion. The tier
  is set per-model in Admin → Comprehension → Model Registry
  (`/admin/comprehension/models`) or falls back to pattern-matching on the
  provider/model name. Pattern-match thresholds: open-weights ≥70B →
  `TierMid`; <70B → `TierLocal` (the default OSS install, `qwen3:32b`, is
  32B and therefore `TierLocal`; the reconcile commit `3145077` lowered the
  mid/local boundary from 30B to 70B to ensure the default install cannot
  re-hit the outage). A transient registry error falls back to `TierLocal`
  rather than reproducing the outage. Also fixes the `wordsPerCitation`
  message-clarity bug: zero-citation pages no longer report a nonsensical
  "1 per ~N words" ratio in the violation message. See
  [`docs/admin/llm-config.md`](docs/admin/llm-config.md#capability-tiers-and-quality-gates)
  for the operator runbook.

- **Living Wiki mode-override flag plumbing in `EnableLivingWikiForRepo`**
  (`aeb92d8`, CA-138). The resolver previously built a fresh
  `RepositoryLivingWikiSettings` from scratch on every call, which (a)
  ignored the input's `LivingWikiOverviewEnabled` / `LivingWikiDetailedEnabled`
  override pointers AND (b) wiped any persisted mode flags from prior
  `setLivingWikiModeFlags` calls. Effect:
  `triggerLivingWikiColdStart(mode: OVERVIEW)` and
  `triggerLivingWikiColdStartAllEnabled` did not actually drive distinct
  cold-start jobs by mode, and every UI save reset the persisted mode flags
  to zero. The fix:
  - Load existing settings; persist a merged record that preserves all
    pre-existing fields the input doesn't explicitly overwrite.
  - Treat `LivingWikiOverviewEnabled` / `LivingWikiDetailedEnabled` as
    TRANSIENT — they drive per-job mode derivation only, never the
    persisted row. Persistence for mode flags remains owned by
    `setLivingWikiModeFlags`.
  - Clear `DisabledAt` on re-enable (matches `UpdateRepositoryLivingWikiSettings`
    semantics).
  - Extracted the job-mode derivation into `deriveLivingWikiJobMode` for
    direct unit-test coverage (no orchestrator stub needed).
  Nine new tests in `living_wiki_mode_flags_test.go` cover the contract
  (`Test*Override*` and `TestDeriveLivingWikiJobMode_*`).

- **gqlgen drift untangle** (`aeb92d8`, CA-138). `gqlgen.yml` now
  preserves the two override pointers via `extraFields` with explicit
  `overrideTags: 'json:"-"'`. Resolver-ownership inversion: four
  resolvers that gqlgen kept duplicating into `schema.resolvers.go`
  (`GenerateLivingWikiPageOnDemand`, `SetRepositoryLLMOverride`,
  `ClearRepositoryLLMOverride`, `LlmOverride`) now live exclusively in
  `schema.resolvers.go`; `living_wiki_on_demand.go` deleted, the helpers
  in `repository_llm_override.resolvers.go` retained. `gqlgen generate`
  is now idempotent (verified via consecutive runs producing zero diff).

- **MCP server reports git-derived version** (`47adbad`, CA-137). The
  SourceBridge MCP server (`internal/api/rest/mcp.go`) previously
  hardcoded `mcpServerVersion = "1.0.0"` in its `initialize` response's
  `serverInfo.version` and the `experimental.sourcebridge.version`
  capability. It now reads `internal/version.Version` — the same symbol
  `/api/v1/version`, `/api/v1/admin/status`, GraphQL `Query.version`,
  and the telemetry sender all use. Every visible version surface on a
  given binary now reports the same string. The MCP **protocol** version
  (`mcpProtocolVersion = "2025-11-25"`) is unchanged.

- **Sigstore cosign keyless OIDC signing for OSS images** (`c10694c`,
  CA-139). All three OSS images (`sourcebridge-api`, `sourcebridge-web`,
  `sourcebridge-worker`) plus the combined release image are signed with
  cosign keyless OIDC on every push to `main`/`dev` and on tagged
  releases. Signatures live next to images in GHCR (and Docker Hub when
  configured). No keys to manage — uses the GHA OIDC token bound to the
  workflow identity, with Fulcio-issued ephemeral certs and Rekor
  transparency-log entries. Pull-request builds are deliberately not
  signed. See `docs/admin/build-info.md` for the verification regex
  (strict / permissive recipes), what it enforces, and how to verify by
  digest when tags drift.

Theme: **Pazaryna — first-run reliability.** Five fixes and features that close
the gap between what a new self-hoster reads and what actually works: a
scriptable admin-bootstrap command, non-interactive login, lazy agentic-feature
activation (so worker startup order no longer matters), fail-fast provider
validation in the Python worker, and walker hardening in `sourcebridge review`.
CI is now green again after a proto-naming lint break and a flaky wall-clock
test.

### Added

- **`sourcebridge setup admin` — scriptable admin bootstrap** (`876c798`,
  CA-127). New subcommand under `sourcebridge setup` that posts to
  `POST /auth/setup`, validates the password client-side (≥8 chars), saves
  the returned session token to `~/.sourcebridge/token` (0600), and prints
  copy-paste-ready next steps with the actual server URL. Supports all three
  non-interactive password vectors (see Changed below). Returns a 409-aware
  error pointing at `sourcebridge login` when the server is already
  initialized. Use `--no-save` to skip writing the session token (useful when
  bootstrapping a server you don't intend to use from this machine).

- **Non-interactive password input for `sourcebridge login` and `sourcebridge
  setup admin`** (`876c798`, CA-127). Three vectors, in strict precedence
  order — exactly one may be set at a time; supplying more than one is
  refused with a "pick exactly one" error:
  - `--password-stdin` — reads one line from stdin. Recommended for CI
    (`echo "$ADMIN_PW" | sourcebridge ...`). Never appears in shell history
    or `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`.
  - `--password-file <path>` — reads from a file; warns to stderr if file
    mode is more permissive than 0600.
  - `SOURCEBRIDGE_PASSWORD` — env var; last resort.
  `--password <value>` is intentionally absent (would leak into shell history
  and `ps`).

- **`out` added to the canonical ignored-directory set** (`201548a`, CA-124).
  `git.DefaultIgnorePatterns` now includes `out` (Next.js static export, Java
  IDEs, several bundlers). The indexer, change-watch, and `sourcebridge review`
  walker all benefit.

- **Visible app version + auto-versioning across releases & dev builds**
  (CA-136). Every running SourceBridge instance now displays a version
  string derived from git, baked into the Go binary via `-ldflags` and
  the web bundle via `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, and exposed at
  `GET /api/v1/version` (public, unauthenticated), `sourcebridge --version`,
  the sidebar footer, the **Admin → System status → Build info** card,
  and the OCI image labels (`org.opencontainers.image.version` and
  friends). Tagged releases produce bare-tag versions
  (`v1.2.3`); commits past the last tag produce `<tag>-dev.N+g<sha>`;
  pull-request builds produce `<tag>-pr<N>+g<sha>`; local builds
  produce `<tag>-local+g<sha>[.dirty]`. The grammar is implemented by
  `scripts/version.sh` (9-case shell test in `tests/scripts/`) and
  consumed identically by the Makefile, the three Dockerfiles,
  `docker-compose.yml`, `build-images.yml`, and `oss-release.yml`.
  The Python worker also exposes a gRPC `VersionService.GetVersion`
  used by the API server to report the worker version. See the new
  [docs/admin/build-info.md](docs/admin/build-info.md) for full
  reference.

### Changed

- **`sourcebridge review` walker uses the canonical ignore list** (`201548a`,
  CA-124). The walk no longer maintains its own four-entry skip list
  (`node_modules`, `.git`, `vendor`, `__pycache__`). It now calls
  `git.IsIgnoredDir` — the same helper the indexer and change-watch pipeline
  use — so `.next/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `out/`, `target/`, and any future
  additions to `DefaultIgnorePatterns` are automatically skipped. The internal
  `findReviewableFiles` helper is now unit-testable and covered by
  `cli/review_walker_test.go`.

- **Agentic features activate lazily instead of at API server boot** (`9d15856`,
  CA-126). Previously the API server probed the worker once during startup
  with six 5-second retries; if all attempts failed the agentic synthesizer
  was never wired and agentic features stayed disabled for the pod's entire
  lifetime — meaning starting the worker after the API server did nothing.
  Now `LazyAgentSynth` defers the probe to the first agentic-eligible request.
  The probe has a 2-second timeout and coalesces concurrent first-request bursts
  via single-flight. A success is cached (and re-validated when the workspace
  LLM config version changes); a failure is retried after a 60-second cooldown.
  A best-effort boot probe still runs in the background: on success it hot-warms
  the cache; on failure it prints a one-line stderr warning (`warning: AI worker
  not reachable at <addr>; ... Start the worker with: make dev-worker`) without
  installing the cooldown, so the first real agentic request after the worker
  comes up activates immediately.

- **Worker config validates providers at startup, not at first call** (`f6f9951`,
  CA-125). `WorkerConfig` now runs pydantic `field_validator`s on
  `llm_provider`, `embedding_provider`, and `llm_report_provider` at
  config-load time. Unknown values produce an actionable error naming the
  supported set rather than a mid-init `NotImplementedError` or bare
  `ValueError`. Anthropic is explicitly noted as unsupported for embeddings in
  the error message. The factory functions retain their own guards as defense
  in depth (the pydantic validator is bypassed by `model_copy(update=...)`,
  the path per-request overrides take). Supported sets: LLM — `anthropic`,
  `openai`, `ollama`, `vllm`, `llama-cpp`, `sglang`, `gemini`, `openrouter`,
  `lmstudio`; embedding — `ollama`, `openai`, `openai-compatible`.

- **Login error message points at `/login`, not `/setup`** (`201548a`, CA-124).
  The "setup not done" error from `sourcebridge login` now directs users to
  `/login` (where Next.js handles initial setup automatically) and includes a
  curl one-liner for headless setups via `POST /auth/setup`.

- **`make dev-worker` is now the canonical worker entry point** (`201548a`,
  CA-124). `Makefile` gained a `dev-worker` target; the README and CLAUDE.md
  were updated to use it everywhere. The previous instruction
  (`cd workers && uv run python -m workers`) broke because absolute imports
  fail when the CWD is `workers/`.

### Fixed

- **`sourcebridge login` error no longer sends users to a 404** (`201548a`,
  CA-124). The "setup not complete" error previously named `/setup`, which
  returns 404. It now names `/login` and provides a curl fallback.

- **Flaky `-race` violation in
  `internal/api/graphql/knowledge_refresh_test.go`** (`993c332`, CA-136).
  `captureSlog` previously created an unsynchronized `*bytes.Buffer` and
  pointed `slog.SetDefault` at it. `enqueueStaleArtifactRefresh` in live
  mode fires `slog.Warn` from a background goroutine the test never
  joins — the handler raced the test's buffer reads. The fix wraps the
  buffer in a `sync.Mutex`-protected writer; the function under test is
  unchanged. Closes the deploy-gate intermittency seen in CI run
  25242941735.

### Internal

- **Proto naming — `AnswerQuestionStream` gets distinct request/response types**
  (`75b5108`, CA-128). `buf` STANDARD lint requires distinct types per RPC.
  `AnswerQuestionStreamRequest` is introduced (field-for-field copy of
  `AnswerQuestionRequest` today, separately evolvable). `AnswerDelta` is
  renamed `AnswerQuestionStreamResponse`. Wire-compatible: proto3 messages
  with the same field tags are indistinguishable on the wire. Generated Go
  and Python stubs regenerated; all consumers updated.

- **67 Go lint errors resolved across the tree** (`75b5108`, CA-128). Mix:
  49 unused symbols, 6 ineffassign, 6 gosimple, 3 staticcheck, 2 errcheck.
  Dead code removed where callers are gone; `//nolint:unused` applied where
  retention is intentional (backward-compat shims, option-pattern parity,
  canonical reference lists).

- **Flaky `TestIndexFiles_DeltaBudgetUnder100ms` replaced with a ratio gate**
  (`75b5108`, CA-128). The old test asserted a 100 ms absolute wall-clock
  ceiling on the single-file delta — marginal on shared CI runners where
  scheduler jitter can push a 14 ms operation past 100 ms. The replacement
  uses a ratio gate (delta/baseline ≤ 0.25) which is hardware-independent,
  plus a 500 ms sanity ceiling for catastrophic regressions where both paths
  blow up.

---

Theme: **Living wiki runtime activation.** The living-wiki feature shipped
as compiled-but-inert code in the prior release; this workstream makes it
actually run. A user can now enable the feature for a specific repo, choose
which sinks to publish to, and watch a Confluence (or Notion, or git-repo)
page appear — driven by a scheduler that wakes up periodically, elects a
leader, respects per-sink rate limits, and persists per-job results the UI
can display. Eight workstreams (R1–R9) cover the full path from data model
to UI panel to sink dispatch, with three testing tiers and a runbook in
`RELEASING.md`. Four deploy-validation bugs were found and fixed before the
feature reached production.

Also: **CI + deploy infrastructure.** A GitHub Actions workflow now builds
and publishes per-SHA, per-branch, and per-tag images to GHCR on every push.
A generic kustomize base at `deploy/kubernetes/base/` gives OSS deployers a
ready-made starting point without copy-pasting manifests.

### Added

- **Per-repo living-wiki settings** (`c841f61`). Data model (`lw_repo_settings`,
  `lw_job_results`), migration 036, and three GraphQL mutations:
  `updateRepositoryLivingWikiSettings`, `enableLivingWikiForRepo`,
  `disableLivingWikiForRepo`, plus an admin-only `repositoriesUsingSink`
  query. Each repo independently selects which sinks to use, which
  audiences to publish for, whether to PR-review or direct-publish, and
  per-sink edit policies. Soft-disable preserves config so re-enable
  restores prior state.

- **Boot wiring and webhook dispatcher** (`88eb809`).
  `internal/livingwiki/assembly/AssembleDispatcher` constructs every
  orchestrator port and the dispatcher in one place. The webhook dispatcher
  starts at boot when `Enabled` is true; disabled-feature paths return 503
  (not 404) with a JSON body so webhook senders can distinguish. Explicit
  shutdown sequence: HTTP drain → `dispatcher.Stop` with 30 s timeout →
  store close. Migration 037 adds `lw_pages` and `lw_watermarks`.
  `SOURCEBRIDGE_LIVING_WIKI_KILL_SWITCH` env var bypasses the feature
  without redeploying.

- **Credential broker with per-job snapshots** (`792ca64`).
  `internal/livingwiki/credentials/Broker` interface and per-job `Snapshot`.
  HTTP clients no longer take credentials in their constructors; they receive
  a Snapshot per call, enforcing the at-most-one-rotation-per-job invariant.
  Credential rotations are recorded on `governance.AuditLog`.

- **Cold-start jobs via the existing LLM activity feed** (`fba7ad7`). Cold-
  start jobs route through `/api/v1/admin/llm/activity` alongside knowledge-
  engine jobs — no second polling loop. Three-category failure classification:
  transient (Retry), auth (Fix credentials deep-link), partial-content (Retry
  excluded pages only). `retryLivingWikiJob` GraphQL mutation scopes retries
  to previously-excluded pages. Per-page progress events are visible in the UI.

- **Per-repo wiki settings panel in the web UI** (`46a96a6`). Six visual states
  (globally-disabled / kill-switch / activation gate / corrupt / cold-start in
  progress / enabled-idle / refinement panel) with progressive disclosure.
  Stage A hides advanced fields behind sensible defaults; Stage B exposes them
  after first generation. Failure banners carry category-specific CTAs.
  Mobile-responsive State 4 summary row. Discoverability callout on the repo
  overview when the wiki is unconfigured.

- **Periodic scheduler with leader election, jitter, and metrics** (`4b472ef`).
  Per-repo FNV-32a jitter is deterministic across restarts; leader election
  reuses the `trash_sweep` lease pattern. Per-tenant concurrency cap and per-
  sink rate limiters (Confluence / Notion / GitHub / GitLab). Five Prometheus
  metric series: `livingwiki_jobs_total`, `livingwiki_pages_generated_total`,
  `livingwiki_validation_failures_total`, `livingwiki_job_duration_seconds`,
  `livingwiki_sink_write_duration_seconds`. Persistent `LivingWikiJobResult`
  store with a per-repo last-result GraphQL field.

- **Sink dispatch wiring** (`a6a532b` R9). `internal/livingwiki/sinks/`
  package with a `SinkWriter` interface and concrete implementations for
  Confluence, Notion, and git-repo. The cold-start runner iterates
  `RepositoryLivingWikiSettings.Sinks`, builds the right writer per kind via
  the assembly factory and credentials snapshot, and pushes generated pages
  through each. Per-sink results (`SinkWriteResults`) persist on
  `LivingWikiJobResult` so the UI can show "Confluence: 22 pages, 0 failed."

- **Three testing tiers** (`acd28dd`). Unit-integration test suite (`make
  test-livingwiki-integration`, build tag `livingwiki_integration`); a real-
  Confluence weekly CronJob smoke test (`cmd/livingwiki-smoke` +
  `deploy/kubernetes/base/cronjobs/livingwiki-smoke.yaml.example`); manual
  release validation runbook in `RELEASING.md`.

- **GitHub Actions image build workflow + kustomize base** (`8e0b128`).
  Per-SHA, per-branch, and per-tag images published to GHCR on every push.
  Generic kustomize base at `deploy/kubernetes/base/` for OSS Kubernetes
  deployments. `dev` branch added to the push trigger.

- **MCP-edits feedback-loop scaffolding (Phase 1.A — refactors only).** Five
  small public-API changes that downstream Phase 1.B–1.E slices will compile
  against. No behavior change for existing call sites; the umbrella
  `SOURCEBRIDGE_CHANGE_WATCH_ENABLED` flag flips with the watcher in 1.C.
  - `git.IsIgnoredPath(repoPath, relPath string) bool` — extracted from
    `ScanRepository`'s inline filtering so the upcoming change-watch pipeline
    and the indexer share one source of truth for ignored paths.
  - `git.HeadRef(repoPath string) (string, error)` — thin wrapper over
    `GetGitMetadata` that returns just the branch name and surfaces
    `git.ErrNotAGitRepo` when there's no `.git` entry, instead of the
    silent `(nil, nil)` the existing helper returns.
  - `indexer.IndexResult.Branch string \`json:"branch,omitempty"\`` — new
    optional field; existing `IndexRepository`/`IndexRepositoryIncremental`
    callers leave it empty (and the JSON tag's `omitempty` keeps the
    serialized shape unchanged for every current consumer).
  - `indexer.Indexer.IndexFiles(ctx, repoPath, files, branch, prev)` —
    signature stub; body returns `indexer.ErrIndexFilesNotImplemented`. The
    Phase 1.B implementation will land the per-file refresh path the
    change-watch router calls; locking the signature here lets downstream
    slices compile.
  - `indexer.RepoIndexFullReason` enum + precondition guard on
    `IndexRepository`. Every existing caller now passes a typed reason
    (`ReasonInitialOnboard` or `ReasonOperatorRebuild`); the change-watch
    router has no reason value to pass and therefore cannot reach the
    whole-tree path.
  Internally: the post-`ComputeImpact` block in the `ReindexRepository`
  GraphQL mutation has been extracted into a reusable
  `applyImpactFromChange` helper with full behavior preservation. Phase 1.B
  ships next.

- **MCP-edits feedback-loop — IndexFiles per-file delta (Phase 1.B).**
  Replaces the `ErrIndexFilesNotImplemented` stub from 1.A with the real
  per-file refresh entry point. The change-watch router (Phase 1.C) and the
  T0 sync-refresh path (also 1.C) will both call `IndexFiles` exclusively;
  the function parses only the listed files, merges into a copy of
  `previousResult`, and recomputes per-`IndexResult` aggregates over the
  merged file set. Existing `IndexRepository` and
  `IndexRepositoryIncremental` callers are unchanged.
  - New sentinel errors: `indexer.ErrBranchMismatch` (load-bearing for
    Risk #4 — a CI push to `main` while an agent works on `feature/x`
    must not silently corrupt the agent's branch-scoped freshness state),
    `indexer.ErrEmptyFiles`, `indexer.ErrPreviousResultRequired`. The
    branch-mismatch wrapped message includes both claimed and head
    branches so the router's `rejected_branch_mismatch` log entry has
    the diagnostic data the plan specifies.
  - Performance: `git.HeadRef` now reads `.git/HEAD` directly (microsecond
    scale) and falls back to `git rev-parse` only for uncommon cases.
    The previous implementation shelled out unconditionally (~30-90 ms
    per call on macOS / shared CI runners), which would have consumed
    most of the 100 ms IndexFiles T0 budget on a single subprocess fork.
    Worktrees (`.git` as a file with a gitdir pointer) and detached
    HEADs are handled in the fast path. The defense-in-depth contract is
    preserved: every IndexFiles call still validates the claimed branch
    against the working-tree HEAD.
  - Phase 1 done-definition tests landed: #6 (IndexFiles 100 ms budget on
    a >= 500-file fixture — observed ~12 ms wall-clock with ~8x headroom),
    #12 in-process half (branch threading + branch-mismatch rejection;
    the router-level half lands in 1.C with a `t.Skip` placeholder
    `TestIndexFiles_RouterBranchMismatch_DeferredTo1C` carrying the
    contract forward), and #11's deferred end-to-end half (the
    `ReindexRepository` GraphQL mutation drives the indexer end-to-end
    against an on-disk fixture and reaches `applyImpactFromChange` with
    a real `ImpactReport` that produces the same observable post-state
    the helper-level test asserts for the synthetic-input case).
  - New shared scaffolding: `internal/indexer/testfixtures.LargeGoRepo`
    materializes a synthetic Go repository (default 500 files across 10
    package buckets, configurable) at `t.TempDir`, git-init'd on the
    configured branch with one initial commit. `WriteFile` / `Commit` /
    `Branch` helpers let tests simulate out-of-band edits, commit them,
    or switch branches. Used by both #6 and #11's e2e half so the e2e
    test does not have to build a one-off fixture harness.
  - The `SOURCEBRIDGE_CHANGE_WATCH_ENABLED` umbrella flag remains off;
    nothing in 1.B is reachable from production paths until the watcher
    + router land in 1.C and the flag flips at the end of 1.E burn-in.

- **MCP-edits feedback-loop — change-watch router + watcher + freshness
  envelope (Phase 1.C).** Lands the in-process feedback loop: a passive
  `internal/changewatch.Watcher` driven by `fsnotify`, the
  `internal/changewatch.Router` that all connectors funnel through, and
  the `_meta.freshness` envelope on every MCP tool response. The
  umbrella `SOURCEBRIDGE_CHANGE_WATCH_ENABLED` flag remains off — Phase
  1.E flips it after burn-in. Production code paths see no change yet.
  - **`internal/changewatch.Router`**: single Submit entry point all
    connectors share. Schema validation → flag gate → repo resolve →
    per-repo aggregate breaker (60/min × 5min across all source kinds
    combined) → per-(repo, source.kind) token bucket → dedup window
    (event_id idempotency + content-hash collapse so fsnotify and
    record_change observing the same edit produce one routed event)
    → branch validation against `git.HeadRef` (rejects mismatch) →
    `Indexer.IndexFiles` under a 100 ms T0 budget → containment
    assertion (no merged file outside the declared affected set) →
    `GraphStore.MergeIndexResult` → impact report + existing
    `applyImpactFromChange` policy → freshness envelope update.
    Goroutine-safe; the clock reference is stored behind
    `sync/atomic.Pointer` so callers reading time from inside a
    critical section don't re-enter the mutex.
  - **`internal/changewatch.Watcher`**: in-process passive connector.
    `fsnotify.Watcher` watching every non-ignored directory under each
    indexed repo, debouncing raw kernel events into per-repo batches,
    stamping a `ChangeEvent` per batch, and submitting to the router.
    macOS support: the watcher resolves symlinks on the input path
    (`filepath.EvalSymlinks`) so the stored repoPath matches the path
    fsnotify reports in event names — without this the
    `/var → /private/var` symlink on macOS made the prefix-match in
    classify silently miss every event for `t.TempDir()`-based repos.
  - **`git.IsIgnoredDir`**: directory-side filter sharing the
    component-name and hidden-prefix rules with `IsIgnoredPath` but
    skipping the unknown-language rule. The watcher uses this during
    its initial walk so plain package directories like `pkg0` aren't
    pruned by the file-shaped rule.
  - **`_meta.freshness` envelope on every MCP tool response** (added
    in this slice — see prior commit `7903efe`). Surfaces `state`,
    `tier`, `branch`, `indexed_commit`, `last_verified_at`, `reason`,
    `partial_refresh` to every consumer. Default-fresh when no
    provider is wired so disabling change-watch never breaks the wire
    contract.
  - **`GraphStore.MergeIndexResult`** (added in commit `056c9b6`):
    per-file delta merge that drops dependent records on the affected
    files and re-inserts them while preserving carry-forward
    Symbol IDs. Production `Store` implements it; the SurrealDB-backed
    persistence path returns `ErrMergeNotSupported` (1.C surfaces this
    through the freshness envelope as `state: "suspect"` rather than
    failing loudly; full SurrealDB merge ships in Phase 4).
  - **Per-repo aggregate circuit breaker semantics**: opens when 5
    consecutive minutes are at or above the configured threshold;
    cooldown lasts the full minute after the last saturated minute
    (head + 2 min), so the very next event is rejected rather than
    landing on the cooldown boundary.
  - Phase 1 done-definition tests landed:
    - **#1 + #3** — `TestIntegration_ExternalEditFlowsToFreshness`:
      real fsnotify watcher attached to a real on-disk git working
      tree (`testfixtures.LargeGoRepo`), real `os.WriteFile` performed
      outside any SourceBridge code, real branch validation against
      the working tree (`HeadRefBranchValidator`), real Router
      pipeline, real `FreshnessForExport` read by the same MCP
      envelope adapter consumers go through. ~300 ms wall-clock with
      a tightened 200 ms debounce.
    - **#2 + #5** — `TestIntegration_RecordChange_FlowsToFreshness`:
      router-level in-process record_change path. The public MCP tool
      surface ships in 1.D; this test pins the router-level contract
      so 1.D's wire-up only needs to exercise the HTTP/MCP plumbing on
      top.
    - **#8** — `TestRouter_RejectsEmptyDelta` +
      `TestRouter_RejectsInvalidPaths`: router rejects empty `files[]`
      and path-traversal attempts before any dispatch.
    - **#9** — `TestRouter_MultiTenantContainment`: events for tenant
      A's repo do not mutate tenant B's freshness envelope or trigger
      any IndexFiles call against B's path.
    - **#10 router half** — `TestIndexRepository_RouterHasNoFullReindexCallPath`:
      AST-walks `internal/changewatch/*.go` (production sources only)
      and fails on any selector expression naming `IndexRepository` or
      `IndexRepositoryIncremental`. Replaces 1.A's `t.Skip` placeholder.
    - **#12 router half** — `TestRouter_RejectsBranchMismatch` +
      `TestRouter_AcceptsRefsHeadsBranchEquivalent`. The indexer-side
      `TestIndexFiles_RouterBranchMismatchHookedTo1C` pins the
      cross-package reference so a future rename of the canonical test
      surfaces at the indexer boundary too. Replaces 1.B's `t.Skip`
      placeholder.
    - **#13** — `TestRouter_PerRepoBreakerTrips`: drives 30 fsnotify +
      30 record_change events per minute for 5 minutes (each kind under
      its 100/min throttle, but 60/min combined per-repo) and verifies
      the breaker trips on minute 6.
    - **#14** — `TestRouter_DedupByContentHashAcrossSourceKinds` +
      `TestRouter_DedupByEventIDIdempotency`: same content_hash from two
      source kinds collapses to one routed event; same event_id replayed
      collapses too.
    - **#15 dir-side** — `TestIsIgnoredDir`: 16 cases pinning the new
      `git.IsIgnoredDir` helper.

- **MCP-edits feedback-loop — connector ingress + `record_change` MCP
  tool (Phase 1.D).** Lands the public HTTP ingress and the in-process
  MCP-tool connector. Together with the fsnotify watcher (1.C) these
  are the three Phase 1 connectors that share the canonical
  `ChangeEvent` schema and funnel through the same `changewatch.Router`
  dispatch path. Both surfaces stay default-off through Phase 1.E
  burn-in.
  - **HTTP ingress endpoint** at `POST /v1/connectors/{id}/events`,
    behind `SOURCEBRIDGE_CONNECTOR_API_ENABLED` (default false). Auth:
    bearer/JWT through the same middleware as other authenticated
    routes (HMAC-SHA256 specific to GitHub webhooks lands in Phase 2).
    Trust stamping locks `received_via=http_ingress`,
    `verification_method=bearer`; connectors cannot claim `in_process`
    via the body. Source.kind is locked to HTTP-ingress-family kinds —
    a remote caller posting `mcp_record_change` or `fsnotify_local`
    is silently rewritten to `http_ingress` (those kinds are reserved
    for in-process connectors with different downstream trust
    assumptions; spoofing them remotely is a privilege-escalation
    shape). `DisallowUnknownFields` on JSON decoding so 0.x callers
    fail loudly when they hit the 1.0 schema rather than silently
    degrading. Outcome → HTTP-status mapping documented as part of the
    Connector API contract: 202 (indexing/deduped), 429 (rate_limited),
    503 (breaker_tripped / change_watch_disabled), 400 (schema /
    no-delta / invalid-paths), 409 (branch_mismatch / unknown_repo),
    500 (unmapped outcomes — alarms loudly so a missing case lights up
    in tests).
  - **`record_change` MCP tool**, the in-process MCP-tool connector
    named in plan v5 §Phase 1 > 4. Inputs: `repository_id`, `files[]`,
    `branch`, optional `intent`, optional `requirement_ids[]`. Output:
    `{accepted, change_id, routed_to, reason, branch, file_count}`.
    Adoption posture per plan v4 decision #4 — easy, never required:
    tool description leads with "Optional"; tool is hidden from
    `tools/list` when the change-watch dispatcher is nil so agents
    don't discover a no-op tool; defense-in-depth path returns
    structured `CAPABILITY_DISABLED` if a hand-crafted `tools/call`
    reaches the handler with the dispatcher unwired.
  - **Trust contract**: `Source.Actor` is derived from the MCP
    session's authenticated identity (`session.claims.UserID@OrgID`),
    NOT from tool args — agents cannot lie about being human.
    `Trust.ReceivedVia="in_process"` stamped at the connector boundary
    so an in-process call cannot claim http transport (the inverse
    spoofing direction).
  - **Path-normalization contract** (plan v5 HIGH fix L3) is enforced
    at three points: `changewatch.NormalizePath` at both ingress
    surfaces (clean MCP / 400 errors), and re-validated by the router
    via `ChangeEvent.Validate` (defense in depth). Contract: repo-
    relative; Unix forward-slash separators only (rejects backslash —
    we don't silently `filepath.ToSlash` so caller-side bugs don't
    slip through); no leading `./` or `/`; no trailing `/`; no `..`
    components; no `//` or `/./` tricks. Case-handling: caller's
    casing is preserved verbatim (Linux is case-sensitive at FS level;
    macOS/Windows are case-insensitive at FS but git treats every
    path case-sensitively regardless — the helper matches git's
    worldview).
  - **Multi-tenant boundary**: `record_change` calls `checkRepoAccess`
    against the session's allowed-repo list + the enterprise
    `MCPPermissionChecker` before any router work. An agent targeting
    an inaccessible repo gets the standard "not found" error (no
    fingerprinting of which repos exist). HTTP ingress relies on the
    auth middleware identity + the router's per-repo state isolation.
  - **Defensive bounds at the tool boundary**: per-call cap of 1024
    files, 1024-byte intent, 100 requirement IDs (256 bytes each).
    Intent is sanitized — ASCII control bytes / non-printable runes
    stripped to defend against log-injection / terminal-escape via
    the structured-log path that records `intent`. Whitespace
    (space/tab/newline/CR) survives so multi-line intents stay
    readable.
  - **`Linking.InvalidateGraceHours` already configurable** (was 24h
    hardcoded; surfaced as `linking.invalidate_grace_hours` /
    `SOURCEBRIDGE_LINKING_INVALIDATE_GRACE_HOURS` in the slice 4
    config-source-of-truth work — covers nice-to-have L1 from plan v5
    without a new flag).
  - Phase 1 done-definition tests landed:
    - **#7 passive-only correctness** —
      `TestPassiveOnly_Phase1DoneDef7`: five scenarios (single-file
      write, multi-file refactor, file addition, file deletion, file
      rename) on a real on-disk fixture with the in-process
      `record_change` MCP tool *never invoked*. Each scenario asserts
      the freshness envelope advances, state transitions correctly,
      `IndexFiles` is called for the affected paths, and the impact
      applier runs. **Load-bearing for the non-goal**: if this test
      ever fails, the change in question violates "no SourceBridge
      feature shall be built that requires `record_change` for
      correctness" and must be revised. Do NOT make the test pass by
      adding `record_change` calls to it.
  - HTTP ingress per-tool tests cover dispatcher-unwired (503),
    happy path (202 with trust populated + connector_id stamped),
    URL→connector_id stamping when body omits it, default `http_ingress`
    kind, trust-overridden-from-body, bad JSON (400), unknown-fields
    rejection (`DisallowUnknownFields`), every router outcome → HTTP
    status mapping, unknown-outcome→500 alarm.
  - `record_change` per-tool tests cover hidden-vs-visible in
    tools/list, happy path with full ChangeEvent shape verification,
    status defaults, path normalization rejection, rename-without-old-
    path rejection, empty-files rejection, tenant-boundary rejection,
    every router outcome → `accepted` boolean mapping, actor always
    derived from session, defense-in-depth on nil dispatcher, plus
    the four xander-pass security tests (oversized files / intent /
    requirement_ids; control-char stripping).
  - The `SOURCEBRIDGE_CHANGE_WATCH_ENABLED` umbrella flag remains off,
    and `SOURCEBRIDGE_CONNECTOR_API_ENABLED` defaults off through
    Phase 1; nothing in 1.D is reachable from production paths until
    1.E flips the flag.

- **MCP-edits feedback-loop — Phase 1 closing (1.E burn-in).** The
  no-new-feature-code phase that gates the `SOURCEBRIDGE_CHANGE_WATCH_ENABLED`
  flag-flip behind a final integration sweep, an operator runbook,
  and a verified done-definition. Phase 1's full commit chain
  (1.A → 1.B → 1.C → 1.D → 1.E) is ready for review.
  - **Cross-package integration sweep** at
    `tests/integration/phase1_changewatch_test.go`. Exercises the full
    closed loop in the order a real edit travels: fsnotify Watcher
    detects external edit → Router validates schema + branch +
    delta-only guardrails → IndexFiles under T0 budget →
    MergeIndexResult → ImpactApplier → freshness envelope updated.
    Confirms the package-boundary wiring (watcher → router →
    FreshnessForExport, the same path the MCP envelope adapter reads)
    beyond what individual sub-phase tests cover.
  - **Operator runbook stub** at `docs/admin/change-watch.md`. Covers
    what change-watch does, what flag-flip activates, what disabling
    does, tuning knobs, observability checklist for the first week,
    rollback procedure, Phase 1 readiness summary, and explicit list
    of what flag-flip does NOT activate (Phase 2-5 deferrals).
  - **All 15 Phase 1 done-definition tests** verified green:
    - #1 + #3 — `TestIntegration_ExternalEditFlowsToFreshness` (1.C)
    - #2 + #5 — `TestIntegration_RecordChange_FlowsToFreshness` (1.C
      router-level) + `TestRecordChange_HappyPath` (1.D tool-level)
    - #6 — `TestIndexFiles_DeltaBudgetUnder100ms` (1.B)
    - #7 — `TestPassiveOnly_Phase1DoneDef7` (1.D, 5 scenarios) —
      load-bearing for the `record_change`-never-required non-goal
    - #8 — `TestRouter_RejectsEmptyDelta` +
      `TestRouter_RejectsInvalidPaths` (1.C)
    - #9 — `TestRouter_MultiTenantContainment` (1.C)
    - #10 — `TestRepoIndexFullReason_GuardRefusesUnspecified` (1.A)
      + `TestRouter_OnlyCallsIndexFiles` (1.C) +
      `TestIndexRepository_RouterHasNoFullReindexCallPath` (1.C)
    - #11 — `applyImpactFromChange` extraction regression (helper
      level 1.A; e2e 1.B)
    - #12 — `TestIndexFiles_BranchMismatchRejected` /
      `TestIndexFiles_BranchMatchAccepted` (1.B in-process half) +
      `TestRouter_RejectsBranchMismatch` /
      `TestRouter_AcceptsRefsHeadsBranchEquivalent` (1.C router half)
    - #13 — `TestRouter_PerRepoBreakerTrips` (1.C)
    - #14 — `TestRouter_DedupByContentHashAcrossSourceKinds` +
      `TestRouter_DedupByEventIDIdempotency` (1.C)
    - #15 — `git.IsIgnoredPath` parity (1.A) + `TestIsIgnoredDir`
      directory-side parity (1.C)
  - **What flag-flip activates after Phase 1.E**: passive fsnotify
    detection, per-repo router with delta-only guardrails, per-(repo,
    source.kind) rate limit + per-repo aggregate breaker, branch
    mismatch rejection, multi-tenant containment, freshness envelope
    on every MCP response, the `record_change` MCP tool (opt-in,
    never required), HTTP ingress at
    `POST /v1/connectors/{id}/events`, path-normalization contract.
  - **What flag-flip does NOT activate** (deferred to later phases):
    `Fast / Balanced / Strict` mode picker (Phase 4),
    `mark-suspect`/`auto-resolve` link state machine (Phase 2), web
    UI freshness chips and change feed (Phase 5), compound-tool
    `LINK_INVALIDATED` refusal (Phase 2), GitHub webhook + App
    connector (Phase 2), `/admin/connectors` admin UI (Phase 2),
    schema promotion `0.x → 1.0` (Phase 2 after the schema-stability
    checkpoint), T2/T3 surgical re-derivation (Phase 3), persistent
    `ca_change_event` table (Phase 5).

### Changed

- **Credential model** (`792ca64`). HTTP clients for all living-wiki sinks
  receive a per-call `Snapshot` rather than credentials baked in at
  construction time, so credential rotation takes effect on the next job
  without restarting any long-lived client.

- **Boot path** (`88eb809`). The living-wiki dispatcher is now part of the
  standard server startup sequence with a defined shutdown contract, rather
  than launched ad hoc.

### Fixed

- **Migration 037 conditional unique indexes** (`adbf4ba`). SurrealDB does not
  support `WHERE` clauses on `DEFINE INDEX`. The two conditional indexes were
  collapsed into a single `(repo_id, pr_id, page_id, kind)` UNIQUE tuple that
  SurrealDB accepts without a predicate.

- **`testConfluenceConnection` endpoint mismatch** (`4fbc197`). The test-
  connection call was hitting `https://api.atlassian.com/me`, an OAuth 2.0
  endpoint that rejects API-token basic auth. Switched to
  `https://<site>.atlassian.net/wiki/rest/api/user/current`, which accepts
  basic auth. A new `confluenceSite` field was added to global settings, the
  UI, and migration 038 to carry the site subdomain.

- **`lw_settings` stale-row schema failures** (`8104c06`, `cb246ec`). The
  original `lw_settings` row predated migrations 036 and 038 that added
  `tenant_id` and `confluence_site`. SurrealDB `DEFAULT` only fires on row
  creation, so the existing row had `NONE` for both fields, failing schema
  validation on every subsequent UPSERT. Migration 039 backfills both fields
  on the existing row, and the UPSERT path now always sets them explicitly.

- **Deep cliff-notes "DEADLINE_EXCEEDED" reaper races** (CA-122,
  `01779d3`...`0b92350`). The seven knowledge gRPCs (cliff notes,
  architecture diagram, learning path, code tour, workflow story,
  explain system, build repository understanding, plus enterprise
  reports) were unary calls with no liveness signal. When the
  hierarchical pipeline took longer than the orchestrator's 10-minute
  stale-job reaper window, the reaper marked the job failed mid-run
  and the gRPC stream got a confusing `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`. Each RPC
  is now server-streaming, with phase markers (`SNAPSHOT`,
  `LEAF_SUMMARIES`, `FILE_SUMMARIES`, `PACKAGE_SUMMARIES`,
  `ROOT_SYNTHESIS`, `RENDER`, `FINALIZING`) and per-phase progress
  events bridged into the existing `ca_knowledge_artifact` row via a
  bounded-channel writer goroutine. The single-call RPCs (no internal
  step counters) emit a phase-only heartbeat every 30s
  (`SOURCEBRIDGE_KNOWLEDGE_STREAM_HEARTBEAT_SECS`-tunable) so the
  orchestrator's `UpdatedAt` stays fresh through a multi-minute
  single LLM call. The reaper now actively cancels active gRPC
  streams instead of just marking the job failed; first-claimant-
  wins finalization prevents the reaper and the run goroutine from
  racing terminal writes; artifact progress writers no-op once the
  artifact is `ready` or `failed` so a late stream-driver flush
  cannot resurrect a terminal row. The synthetic 5-second progress
  ticker is fully deleted (`startProgressTicker` /
  `runProgressTicker` / `progressPhaseLabel` are gone). One known
  gap, documented in
  `internal/api/rest/enterprise_routes.go`: the enterprise
  `SetReportGenerator` callback still runs on `context.Background()`,
  so HTTP client disconnects do not cancel an in-flight report; the
  signature change is tracked as a follow-up. New operator config:
  `sourcebridge.knowledge.rpc_safety_net_timeout` (default 4h) is
  the hard cap once the streaming heartbeat is established, set via
  `POST /api/v1/admin/knowledge/rpc-safety-net-timeout`. New stream
  bucket maps in `internal/api/graphql/knowledge_stream_driver.go`
  give file/symbol/module cliff-notes scopes a collapsed
  `SNAPSHOT -> RENDER -> FINALIZING` progress contract that does not
  regress when the worker's hierarchical strategy uses internal
  phase counters.

Theme: **Living wiki + auto-extracted doc templates.** SourceBridge can now
generate and maintain a coherent, cited wiki directly from your codebase —
opening a PR within 90 seconds of enabling the feature, appending additive
commits on subsequent pushes without force-pushing or overwriting reviewer
edits, and publishing to nine sink targets from a single canonical page
model. Every citation in every report, QA answer, and compliance artifact
now speaks the same `(path:start-end)` contract, so the VS Code plugin can
jump to the exact line a generated page is talking about.

Also: **Claude Code Quickstart.** One command (`sourcebridge setup claude`)
turns any indexed repo into Claude Code-aware — generating a per-subsystem
`.claude/CLAUDE.md` with concrete graph-derived "Watch out:" guidance,
registering the MCP server, and exposing three new MCP tools that let
agents query subsystem boundaries before they refactor. Subsystems are
detected automatically by label-propagation clustering over the call graph
and surfaced in a new web UI tab with inline-editable, LLM-improvable
labels. Living Wiki taxonomy now consumes the same clusters as its primary
"areas" signal, so a single source of truth drives both the wiki and the
agent integration.

### Added

- **Subsystem clustering on the call graph** (`a6a532b`). New
  `internal/clustering/` package runs label propagation (Raghavan / Albert
  / Kumara 2007) over the symbol call graph as an async job after each
  index — never blocks indexing, recomputes only when the SHA-256 of
  sorted edge tuples changes. Migration 040 adds `cluster` and
  `cluster_member` tables. Atomic `ReplaceClusters` wraps delete+insert
  in a SurrealDB transaction so readers never see an empty mid-update
  window. `DeleteClusters` is wired into `RemoveRepository` and
  `ReplaceIndexResult` for orphan-free invalidation. Modularity Q, size
  distribution (min/max/p50/p95), and partial-convergence flag logged
  per run; surfaced via `GET /api/v1/admin/clustering/stats` for ops
  visibility. Four new telemetry fields (`clustering_enabled`,
  `cluster_count`, `clustering_modularity_q`, `agent_setup_used`)
  documented in `TELEMETRY.md`.

- **Three new MCP tools for subsystem awareness** (`a6a532b`).
  `get_subsystems(repo_id)` returns the cluster list with representative
  symbols and cross-cluster call counts. `get_subsystem_by_id(cluster_id)`
  returns the full member list for a known cluster ID.
  `get_subsystem(symbol_id)` returns the cluster a given symbol belongs to
  plus 5 peers. Response shape uses `representative_symbols` plus a
  `selection_method` metadata field so the underlying ranking strategy
  (today: highest in-degree) can change without breaking agent contracts.
  Gated by a new `subsystem_clustering` capability (OSS + Enterprise).

- **Subsystems tab in the web UI** (`a6a532b`). New tab on the repo
  detail page renders a sortable table with cluster label, member count,
  top 3 representative symbols as code chips, and a "Calls into"
  cross-cluster adjacency hint. Cluster labels are inline-editable —
  saving fires a single-cluster LLM rename job; an "Improve labels"
  button kicks off a batch rename for the whole repo with a 10-minute
  polling timeout and humanized error states. Sortable headers use
  `<button>` inside `<th>` with `aria-sort` and ≥44px touch targets;
  long symbol names truncate to a `max-w-[200px]` chip with full-name
  tooltip. Capability-gated on `subsystem_clustering`.

- **Living Wiki taxonomy uses clusters as the primary "areas" signal**
  (`a6a532b`). `TaxonomyResolver.Resolve()` accepts clusters as a
  call-time parameter symmetric with `pkgGraph`. When clusters exist,
  generated wiki pages follow architectural cluster boundaries instead
  of mechanical package boundaries — a Confluence page titled "Auth &
  Sessions" describing 14 symbols across `auth`, `middleware`, and
  `session` packages, instead of three disjoint per-package pages.
  Falls back to package-path heuristics when clusters are absent or
  stale. The cold-start runner now fetches clusters and translates them
  to `ClusterSummary` in production, not just in tests.

- **`sourcebridge setup claude` command + per-subsystem skill cards**
  (`a6a532b`). One command writes `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (with per-subsystem
  `## Subsystem:` sections), registers the SourceBridge MCP server in
  `.mcp.json` via idempotent merge that preserves foreign keys, creates a
  `.claude/sourcebridge.json` sidecar (repo ID, server URL, last index
  timestamp, generated-files manifest), and patches `.gitignore`.
  Generated CLAUDE.md is reference-card-shaped: each subsystem section
  names its packages, member count, representative symbols, and concrete
  "Watch out:" lines derived from the call graph — `cross-package-
  callers` (a symbol with callers in ≥3 top-level packages) and
  `hot-path` (the highest in-degree symbol in a cluster). Marker-based
  idempotency (`<!-- sourcebridge:start/end -->`) with section-hash
  user-edit detection means re-runs preserve handcrafted edits unless
  `--force`. CI mode (`--ci` or `CI=true`) exits non-zero when
  stale-but-skipped sections exist. A repo-specific "Try this first"
  prompt seeded with the two largest clusters demos the integration on
  the first interaction. Differentiated CLI errors for server-unreachable
  vs repo-not-found vs repo-not-indexed. `--dry-run` produces a per-file
  diff (`[CREATE]`/`[MODIFY]`/`[SKIP — user-modified]`) with reasons
  inline.

- **`internal/skillcard/` package** (`a6a532b`). Pure generation logic
  with native input types (no wiki imports). Files: `generator.go`,
  `warnings.go` (heuristics), `render.go` (style guide enforced in a
  comment at top: no filler, no document-shaped headings, only graph-
  derived facts), `writer.go` (marker-based idempotent CLAUDE.md merge
  with orphan-marker safety and `--force` recovery), `mcpjson.go`
  (`.mcp.json` merge with conflict-on-different-command abort + invalid-
  JSON backup), `sidecar.go` (v0→v1 migration), `gitignore.go`
  (idempotent patch), `diff.go` (dry-run output).

- **Cluster API extended with packages and warnings** (`a6a532b`). The
  `GET /api/v1/repositories/{id}/clusters` endpoint computes per-cluster
  packages and call-graph warnings server-side using
  `skillcard.DeriveWarnings`, so the setup CLI can render insight-rich
  CLAUDE.md without re-fetching the full call graph itself. Each warning
  carries a `symbol`, `kind`, and human-readable `detail`.

- **Discoverability surfaces for the Claude Code integration**
  (`a6a532b`). Three closure points so users find the command:
  (1) post-`sourcebridge index` CLI hint prints the exact
  `setup claude` invocation with the resolved repo ID and a thousands-
  separator symbol count, (2) "Use with Claude Code" card on the repo
  Settings tab in the web UI (capability-gated on `agent_setup`) with a
  one-click copyable command, (3) "Using with Claude Code" section in
  the README linking to Anthropic's CLAUDE.md memory docs.

- **Citation contract unified across all report paths** (`f48ac47`). New
  `internal/citations` package — `Citation` struct, `Format()`, `Parse()` —
  replaces ad-hoc formatters in QA, MCP accessors, and the VS Code plugin.
  Every surface now emits `(path:start-end)` or `sym_<id>`; the plugin
  handles both `path:line` and `path:start-end` ranges via
  `citationToFileLocation`.

- **Quality framework** (`4411950`). Eight validators (`vagueness`,
  `empty_headline`, `code_example_present`, `citation_density`,
  `reading_level`, `architectural_relevance`, `factual_grounding`,
  `block_count`) with per-template profiles per audience
  (engineer / product / operator). Gates vs. warnings are configured
  per-template — ADRs don't need the same citation density as API ref pages.
  Gate failure triggers one retry with the rejection reason injected into the
  prompt; second failure excludes the page and surfaces the reason in the PR
  description.

- **Page dependency model + canonical Page AST** (`f4f40e1`). Every
  generated page carries a typed `DependencyManifest` (paths, symbols,
  upstream/downstream packages, `dependency_scope`, `stale_when` conditions)
  so the system knows exactly which pages to regenerate when a diff lands.
  Pages are internally a tree of typed blocks with stable IDs — sticky to
  logical position, not derived from content — and four-state ownership
  (`generated`, `human-edited`, `human-edited-on-pr-branch`, `human-only`).
  Per-sink overlay storage keeps sink-divergent edits out of the canonical
  AST without losing them.

- **Edit governance** (`826d8b2`). Three per-sink edit policies:
  `local_to_sink` (edit stays in that sink's overlay; canonical unchanged),
  `promote_to_canonical` (edit syncs back and propagates to all sinks), and
  `require_review_before_promote` (edit opens a sync-PR). Default policy per
  sink kind: `promote_to_canonical` for git-repo sinks (PR review already
  happened), `require_review_before_promote` for GitHub/GitLab built-in
  wikis, `local_to_sink` for Confluence/Notion. Full audit trail on every
  promotion and sync-PR disposition.

- **Glossary, Activity Log, and ADR templates** (`64dbc51`). Three
  auto-extracted doc templates:
  - *Glossary* — zero-LLM, one entry per exported symbol from the graph,
    deterministic, updates on reindex.
  - *Activity log* — commit-graph bucketed by author and week; optional
    LLM weekly-digest pass behind a config flag.
  - *Decision records* — detects `decision:`/`adr:` commit prefixes and
    `BREAKING CHANGE:` bodies; single LLM pass in ADR format (Context /
    Decision / Consequences).

- **Cold-start to PR in ≤ 90s** (`ad2096e`). `living_wiki` report type with
  `git_repo` sink: generator produces a `proposed_ast`, `markdown_writer`
  renders it, SourceBridge opens a `wiki: initial generation (sourcebridge)`
  PR. On merge, `proposed_ast` promotes to `canonical_ast`. On rejection,
  `proposed_ast` is discarded and cold-start retries on next push. Direct-
  publish mode (skip the review gate) is an opt-in per-repo setting.

- **Two-watermark incremental updates with additive commits** (`da2a7b6`).
  Two markers per repo: `source_processed_sha` (last commit the generator
  ran for) and `wiki_published_sha` (last merged-wiki baseline). Incremental
  runs diff against the published baseline, not the unmerged PR head.
  Subsequent pushes while a PR is open append a new commit
  (`wiki: incremental update (<sha>)`) to the existing PR branch — no
  force-push, no orphaned inline comments, no overwritten reviewer tweaks.
  Reviewer commits to the PR branch mark affected blocks
  `human-edited-on-pr-branch` in `proposed_ast`; subsequent bot commits
  leave those blocks alone.

- **GitHub/GitLab wiki and static-site sinks** (`3f7f252`). `github_wiki`
  and `gitlab_wiki` sinks push AST → markdown to the repo's built-in wiki
  (no PR gate; configurable 24h delay queue). Static-site sinks:
  `backstage_techdocs`, `mkdocs`, `docusaurus`, `vitepress` — all use the
  same `markdown_writer` path as `git_repo`, different output paths. Stale-
  detection banners rendered as native callouts per sink: top-of-page
  blockquote (markdown), `info` macro (Confluence), `callout` block
  (Notion).

- **Confluence and Notion API sinks** (`8f5d64c`). `confluence_writer`
  emits AST → Confluence storage XHTML with block IDs preserved as
  `ac:macro` parameters; pages reconciled by `external_id` in Confluence
  metadata. `notion_writer` emits AST → Notion block API with block IDs as
  `external_id` properties. Both perform block-level reconciliation on each
  write — only changed generated blocks are updated; human-edited blocks are
  left alone.

- **Post-merge sink reconciliation + page migrations** (`ad892d4`). After a
  wiki PR merges, the orchestrator reconciles all sinks: sink-overlay blocks
  compose `canonical + overlay[sink]` on render; `human-edited` blocks
  promoted from the PR branch are frozen in canonical. Explicit
  `BlockMigration` ops (moved / split / merged / renamed) surface in PR
  descriptions so reviewers can see what restructuring happened without
  diffing the whole file.

- **Real infrastructure adapters wired** (`822e1de`, `5622cd2`, `84baa65`):
  - `GraphMetricsProvider` backed by the existing `graph.GraphStore` — page
    IDs of the form `<repoID>.arch.<pkg>` map to package paths; replaces the
    `ConstGraphMetrics` test stub in production.
  - `DiffProvider` and `ExtendedRepoWriter` via `os/exec` git CLI calls,
    matching the pattern in `internal/git/local.go`. SHA-not-found signals
    from stderr trigger the force-push recovery path.
  - HTTP clients for GitHub, GitLab, Confluence, and Notion — all stdlib
    `net/http`, no SDK dependencies. Rate-limit headers honored on GitHub
    (`X-RateLimit-Remaining/Reset`) and GitLab; bounded exponential backoff
    on 5xx and 429. GitHub branch commits use the five-step Git Data API
    dance; GitLab uses the repository-commits `actions` array for atomic
    multi-file commits.
  - Webhook event dispatcher with per-repo goroutine serialization
    (different-repo events run concurrently, same-repo events never overlap)
    and fixed-capacity LRU idempotency by delivery ID.
  - `POST /webhooks/confluence` validates `X-Confluence-Signature`
    (HMAC-SHA256) and maps `page_updated` events to the dispatcher.
  - `POST /webhooks/notion-poll` accepts poll-trigger events from the Notion
    integration.

- **UI-configurable living-wiki settings** (`0cf3108`). Full settings page
  at `/settings/living-wiki` with progressive disclosure: general settings
  (enabled toggle, worker count, event timeout) visible by default;
  integration sections (GitHub, GitLab, Confluence, Notion) and webhook
  secrets collapsed until needed. Seven secret fields stored with field-level
  encryption; the API returns `"********"` for any set secret — clients can
  replace or clear but never read back plaintext. Test-connection buttons for
  each integration. Precedence: UI value > env var > default, so existing
  env-var deployments keep working without migration.

### Fixed

- **CLI integration tests** (`16fdba6`). `TestCLIReview*` and `TestCLIAsk*`
  were invoking `uv run python` without `SOURCEBRIDGE_TEST_MODE=1` in the
  subprocess environment, so each test spawned a real Anthropic API call and
  exited 1 with an auth error. The `FakeLLMProvider` in
  `workers/common/llm/fake.py` was already designed for this case but the
  env var was never wired into `cmd.Env`. New `testEnv(extras...)` helper
  adds `SOURCEBRIDGE_TEST_MODE=1` to the inherited environment; new
  `requireUV(t)` calls `t.Skip()` explicitly when `uv` is not on PATH so
  contributors without a Python environment don't see silent failures. All
  six tests now pass.
- **Non-deterministic API reference symbol order** (`822e1de`). The API
  reference template iterated over a Go map (`byPkg`), producing different
  symbol orderings across runs and phantom diffs in
  `samples/wiki-example/`. Now iterates over the already-sorted package
  slice and emits symbols sorted by name within each package.

### Changed

- **Telemetry platform override** (`8dfb80b`). New
  `SOURCEBRIDGE_TELEMETRY_PLATFORM` env var lets dev and CI installs
  override the auto-detected platform string in telemetry pings. Set it to
  `test` and the collector's auto-flag rule excludes the install from public
  counts — replaces the per-install "remember to call mark-test after every
  fresh install" workflow with a one-liner at deploy time. `resolvePlatform()`
  falls back to `runtime.GOOS/GOARCH` when the var is unset; default
  behavior is unchanged.

---

Theme: **MCP as a first-class client surface.** SourceBridge's capabilities
are now exposed through a complete Model Context Protocol server — not the
minimum-viable handful, but the full retrieval/analysis/lifecycle surface a
serious coding agent needs. Three phases, 19 tools, a capability registry
that's the single source of truth across MCP + GraphQL + REST, structured
errors, cursor pagination, compound workflows, and real intra-agentic-loop
progress events streaming through SSE.

### Added

- **MCP Phase 1a — accessor tools.** `get_callers`, `get_callees`,
  `get_file_imports`, `get_architecture_diagram`, `get_recent_changes`.
  Each takes `{repository_id, file_path, symbol_name, line_start?}` and
  returns the structured graph projection the UI uses, now directly
  addressable by an agent.
- **MCP Phase 1b — intent-shaped tools.** `get_tests_for_symbol` merges
  persisted `RelationTests` edges, filename-adjacency heuristics, and
  text-reference scans into a single result set where each hit is tagged
  with `match_sources: []` so the agent can see which signals agreed.
  `get_entry_points` classifies entries in both `basic` and
  `framework_aware` modes (Grails controllers, FastAPI routers, Go
  `http.Handler`, Next.js `app/api/.../route.ts`). `get_recent_changes`
  symbol-scopes `git log -L`.
- **MCP Phase 2 — workflow tools.** `review_diff_against_requirements`
  takes a commit range or explicit file list, resolves touched symbols,
  and cross-references linked requirements to flag public symbols with
  no coverage. `impact_summary` composes callers + tests + linked
  requirements in one call. `onboard_new_contributor` returns a ranked
  reading list of entry points with cliff notes and recent-activity
  authorship. Server-side composition so clients aren't forced to
  orchestrate 4–6 round-trips.
- **MCP Phase 2.2 — prompts surface.** `prompts/list` + `prompts/get`
  expose three curated workflows as MCP prompts for clients that prefer
  them over tool composition.
- **MCP Phase 2.3 — cursor pagination.** Shared `encodeCursor` /
  `decodeCursor` / `paginateSlice[T]` helpers return opaque base64 JSON
  cursors. Every list-returning tool now carries `{total, next_cursor}`.
- **MCP Phase 2.5 — real agent-loop progress events.** The agentic
  QA loop emits structured `planning` / `tool_call` / `tool_result` /
  `synthesizing` / `done(reason)` events through a new `qa.ProgressEmitter`;
  a `contentEmitterProgressAdapter` bridges them to the MCP SSE path so
  streaming clients see live `[agent] → search_evidence` /
  `[agent] ← search_evidence (231ms)` markers instead of a 30s blank wait.
- **MCP Phase 2.6 — structured error envelope.** `{ isError: true, content,
  _meta.sourcebridge: { code, remediation } }` — vanilla MCP clients still
  get a readable text body; capability-aware clients get a machine-actionable
  code (`SYMBOL_NOT_FOUND`, `REPOSITORY_NOT_FOUND`, `INVALID_CURSOR`, …) and
  a concrete next step. Back-compat safe.
- **MCP Phase 3 — capability registry.** `internal/capabilities/registry.go`
  is the single source of truth for what's available in which edition.
  Drives the MCP `tools/list` filter, the `initialize` response
  (`experimental.sourcebridge.features`), GraphQL `__schema` gating, and
  REST config responses. Test suite enforces no duplicate names, every
  capability has at least one edition, and no tool is gated by two
  capabilities.
- **MCP Phase 3.2 — indexing lifecycle tools.** `index_repository`,
  `get_index_status`, `refresh_repository`. Remote git URLs now flow
  through the extracted `internal/indexing.Service` end-to-end — clone,
  parse, persist, without the GraphQL resolver as the critical path.
- **MCP Phase 3.4 — `get_cross_repo_impact`** (enterprise). Hidden on OSS
  editions via the capability registry, visible and functional on
  enterprise.
- **RelationTests edge persistence.** The indexer now emits
  `test_for` edges during the resolve pass instead of recomputing them
  at query time. `Store.GetTestsForSymbolPersisted` exposes the cached
  view; `get_tests_for_symbol` uses it as one of three merged sources.
- **Shared `internal/indexing.Service`.** Import and reindex logic lifted
  out of the GraphQL resolver so MCP, CLI, and future surfaces share one
  path. Exposes `IsGitURL`, `NormalizeGitURL`, `GitCloneCmd`,
  `sanitizeRepoName`, `deriveRepoName` as supporting helpers.
- **Compliance collector wiring.** GitHub platform collector now composes
  into the compliance orchestrator via a routes adapter; the
  `/api/v1/compliance` surface is mounted under the enterprise router
  group and wrapped in JWT + tenant middleware.

### Changed

- **GraphQL + REST edition checks migrated to the capability registry.**
  Direct `cfg.Edition == "enterprise"` comparisons in
  `internal/api/graphql/resolver.go` and `internal/api/rest/llm_config.go`
  are now `capabilities.IsAvailable("per_op_models",
  capabilities.NormalizeEdition(...))`. Reduces the risk of gate drift as
  new capabilities land.
- **`ask_question` now streams.** The `slowToolNames` allowlist in
  `internal/api/rest/mcp_progress.go` gained `ask_question` so the
  streamable-HTTP path triggers and the adapter has a channel to push
  agent-loop events onto.

### Removed

- Nothing shipping. 20 commits of additive surface.

## [0.9.0-rc.2] — 2026-04-23

Second prerelease. Two material changes on top of rc.1: a reliability
fix for rolling deploys and a quality win on ownership questions.
Paired benchmark vs the Phase-3 agentic baseline now shows
**+5.83% overall** (65.83% → 71.67% useful-rate) and a **+8%**
gain on ownership, up from the **-8% regression** rc.1 shipped with.

### Fixed

- **Split-brain agentic deployment on rolling rollouts.** Under a
  rolling deploy, the API pod could probe the worker's capability
  endpoint before the worker Pod reached Ready, fail, and stay on
  the single-shot path for its entire lifetime. The sibling pod,
  probed seconds later, would wire agentic normally — so 50% of
  traffic silently routed to single-shot until a manual restart.
  The startup probe now retries up to 6× with 5s backoff (30s
  window), so both pods converge on the same capability state
  and benchmark samples land on the intended code path.
- **Ownership-class fabrication from advisory file candidates.**
  The smart classifier's `file_candidates` hint field was being
  treated as a citation anchor by the synthesis turn on ownership
  questions, which rewarded "plausible-sounding but unverified
  path" citations and scored as fabrication. Fix: render
  `file_candidates` only for classes that benefit from a seed
  entry file (architecture, execution_flow, cross_cutting) — the
  classes where the model would otherwise have to search from
  scratch. Ownership and behavior questions now see only symbol
  and topic hints, which work as search queries rather than
  citation anchors.

### Changed

- **Quality: ownership 76% → 84% (+8%)**, cross_cutting 56% → 60%
  (+4%), overall 65.83% → 71.67% (+5.83%) on the 120-question
  benchmark (Opus-4.7 judge). Architecture stays at 84%.
  Execution_flow 80% → 76% (-4%, one question, within noise).
- Prompt-cache read ratio of 99.6% on the benchmark run; ~70%
  input-token cost savings vs pre-cache.

`benchmarks/qa/reports/2026-04-23_surgical_v2_vs_agentic/report.md`.

## [0.9.0-rc.1] — 2026-04-23

Theme: **ask smarter, not harder.** A new agentic retrieval loop, a
server-side deep-QA orchestrator, and a hybrid search backbone plugged into
the deep pipeline. Measured quality gains on a 120-question parity
benchmark with LLM-as-judge.

### Added

- **Agentic retrieval loop.** Phases 0–4.5 ship a tool-dispatching agent
  synthesizer that swaps passive retrieval for an explicit plan → call
  tools → cite answer loop. Tools include `search_evidence`,
  `find_tests`, and a query decomposition pre-pass. The agent
  capability probe runs unconditionally at startup and is wired into
  the REST server. Paired-benchmark result vs Phase-3 baseline:
  **+10.00% overall quality**, with another **+3.33%** added by the
  Phase-5 quality push.
- **Anthropic prompt caching on the agentic loop** (quality-push Phase 1)
  — repeated tool-call framing is cached across turns, cutting token
  cost without changing answer fidelity.
- **Smart classifier + seed-context routing** (quality-push Phase 2) —
  the classifier picks a retrieval strategy per question class instead
  of running the full pipeline for every query.
- **`find_tests` agent tool** (quality-push Phase 3) — lets the agent
  pull in the test file that exercises a symbol when the question is
  about behavior, not structure.
- **Query decomposition pre-pass** (quality-push Phase 4) — gated to
  architecture-class questions where sub-question routing actually
  helped the judges; skipped on everything else to avoid latency
  churn.
- **Server-side deep-QA pipeline.** A new `internal/qa` orchestrator
  runs the deep ask flow on the API side with readiness gating and a
  CTA fallback when the pipeline can't complete. Exposed as a
  GraphQL `ask` mutation, a `POST /api/v1/ask` REST endpoint, and an
  MCP `ask_deep` tool. CLI auto-picks the server path when
  `/healthz` advertises QA. The old `cli_ask.py` deep mode now prints
  a deprecation warning.
- **Deep pipeline uses hybrid search.** The deep-QA path now calls
  the hybrid `search.Service` (Phases 1–6 from the prior release) as
  its retriever instead of the legacy grep path — requirements,
  files, symbols, and signals all flow through one ranked backbone.
- **QA parity benchmark.** 120 curated questions across architecture,
  execution flow, domain concepts, and requirements grounding, with
  an LLM-as-judge runner (`benchmarks/qa/`). Baseline vs candidate
  arms, per-question judgments, per-arm environment capture, and a
  rollup report. Seed script + per-question repo-path mapping let
  the candidate run inside a k8s worker pod or against a remote
  instance.
- **Fallback-compat CI lane** — a dedicated workflow that exercises
  the pipeline with the agentic loop disabled so the fallback path
  can't regress silently.
- **Ops docs** — `docs/admin/server-side-qa-rollout.md` with staged
  canary instructions and rollout decisions finalized (Q5.6 / Q6.1 /
  Q7.1); `docs/admin/telemetry-collector-qa-fields.md` for the
  collector-side field additions that QA adoption needs.

### Fixed

- **`find_tests` schema**: Anthropic's API rejects `anyOf` at the
  `input_schema` root. The tool definition now expresses the variant
  shape without the root-level union so cloud and local models
  accept the same schema.
- **Smart-classifier fabrication**: dropped `file_candidates` from
  the classifier's seed prompt, which was inviting the model to
  invent plausible-but-non-existent file paths.
- **Agentic deadlines** iteratively tuned — **60 s / 30 s** first,
  then **90 s / 45 s** wall/per-turn after the initial setting
  truncated legitimate long answers. Decomposition sub-loop budget
  bumped **30 s → 60 s**.
- **Agentic `search_evidence` init order** — the tool was being
  registered before the search service was ready on startup; moved
  service init before QA wiring so the tool is usable on the first
  request.
- **Citation fallback widened** to scan every tool-result turn, not
  just the final turn, so an answer stitched together from earlier
  tool calls still carries the evidence citations forward.

### Changed

- **Decomposition gate narrowed to architecture-only** (post-Phase 5).
  The quality-push evaluation showed decomposition helped
  architecture questions but hurt execution-flow and concrete
  questions; the gate now reflects that.
- **Default prod posture** recorded in
  `thoughts/shared/plans/` as the surgical config — Phase-5
  decomposition + architecture gate + agentic loop + hybrid search
  is the baseline unless overridden.
- **Q5.1–Q5.6 deep-QA migration series** — `discussCode` context
  ported into the orchestrator, GraphQL `ask` adapter added,
  synthesis routed through the LLM job orchestrator, telemetry
  fields reserved for QA adoption, CLI and REPL re-pointed at the
  server path.

### Infrastructure

- `.claude/scheduled_tasks.lock` added to `.gitignore`.
- Judge docs pointed at the canonical
  `automation/anthropic-api-credentials` secret path used by other
  benchmarks.
- QA benchmark reports live in `benchmarks/qa/reports/` alongside
  the runner output so rollouts can diff arms over time.

---

## [0.8.0-rc.1] — 2026-04-21

Release candidate for 0.8.0. Theme: **token streaming end-to-end**, first-class
requirement CRUD, and the VS Code extension relocated into this repository
so the full stack lives in one place.

### Added

- **Streaming discussion answers** via a new `AnswerQuestionStream` gRPC
  alongside the existing unary `AnswerQuestion`. The worker yields LLM
  content deltas as they're generated; the API relays them through
  **two delivery surfaces**:
  - **MCP**: `explain_code` progress notifications carry a `delta` field
    that the VS Code plugin appends to the running answer in real time.
  - **REST SSE**: new `POST /api/v1/discuss/stream` endpoint emits
    `event: token` / `event: done` / `event: error` frames. The web UI's
    Discuss page consumes them through `src/lib/askStream.ts`.
  No more 30–90 s of "Thinking…" on a local model — users see tokens as
  they land.
- **Requirement CRUD** mutations on GraphQL: `createRequirement` (with
  auto-generated `REQ-<uuid>` external IDs and uniqueness enforcement) and
  `updateRequirementFields` (partial patch semantics — explicit nulls
  clear fields, omitted fields preserve them). Matching web flows:
  CreateRequirementDialog, inline EditRequirementCard, RemoveRequirementDialog.
  `acceptanceCriteria` round-trips through the full stack.
- **VS Code extension (0.3.0)** now lives in `plugins/vscode/`. Packaged via
  `make package-vscode` / `make install-vscode`. Features: code-action
  lightbulbs, `Cmd+I` streaming chat, `Cmd+K N` field guides, `Cmd+Shift+;`
  scoped palette, Change Risk sidebar tree, inline requirement CRUD,
  opt-in telemetry, ARIA labels throughout. Status-bar connection indicator
  with auto-reconnect.
- **Namespace-local Redis** support for MCP session storage (HA across
  replicas). Enterprise deployment now ships its own Redis manifest so
  MCP sessions don't collide with OSS.

### Fixed

- **Qwen thinking-disable on Ollama**. The previous implementation only
  sent the llama.cpp-specific `chat_template_kwargs={"enable_thinking":
  False}`, which Ollama ignores — Qwen 3.5 MoE burned its entire
  `max_tokens` budget inside an unemitted thinking block and returned
  empty content with `stop_reason=length`. Now also sends the `/no_think`
  directive in the user message for Qwen-family models; both backends work
  without runtime detection.
- **Orchestrator stale-inflight claim release**. An API pod that failed a
  job in-memory during a worker-pod startup race kept the dead job's ID
  in its inflight registry, so every identical request deduped to that
  failed job forever until the pod restarted. `Enqueue` now detects
  terminal states on claim collisions and retries with a fresh job.
- **arm64 release binaries** now build on a native `ubuntu-24.04-arm`
  runner. Cross-compiling from amd64 with `CGO_ENABLED=1` was failing on
  tree-sitter's arm64 assembly.
- **Release packaging** skips the `*.dockerbuild` provenance artifact so
  the release job doesn't retry 5× on a flaky artifact download.
- **SemVer prerelease tags** (hyphenated suffixes like `-rc.1`, `-beta.2`,
  `-alpha`) are now auto-flagged as prerelease on GitHub.

### Changed

- **Trash retention worker** matured into Phase 1 complete — telemetry,
  lint clean, SurrealDB round-trip fixed (dropped the unsupported COMMIT
  wrap; fixed the SCHEMAFULL NONE-field backfill trap in migration 030).
- **Knowledge artifact regeneration** is now delta-driven: a shadow
  pipeline computes which scopes' evidence actually changed on reindex
  and only those are flagged stale. Replaces the scorched-earth
  full-rebuild behavior.
- **Selective knowledge-artifact invalidation** on reindex — unchanged
  scopes stay READY.
- **GraphQL extension timeouts** raised to 180 s for LLM operations
  (`DiscussCode`, `ReviewCode`, `ExplainSystem`, `GenerateCliffNotes`,
  `GenerateLearningPath`, `GenerateCodeTour`). Previous 10 s ceiling was
  cutting off the server mid-response.

### Infrastructure

- Enterprise Dockerfiles live in-tree so Tekton builds them alongside
  OSS images without a parallel repo.
- Web, worker, and Go CI pipelines now all pass cleanly on the same push.

---

## [0.7.0] — 2026-04-19

**Runtime reconfiguration and API cleanup.**

### Added

- **Runtime orchestrator reconfiguration** — change `MaxConcurrency` on a
  live instance without a restart. The Admin Monitor page surfaces a
  provider-aware recommended value based on the model size + hosting
  mode, and `handleUseRecommended` wires the chosen value into the orchestrator.
- **Provider-aware concurrency recommendations** — `MaxConcurrency`
  suggestion per provider × model class (small local, large local MoE,
  cloud API), calibrated against the bench harness.
- **Enterprise report RPC shim** — reserves the wire surface for the
  commercial report-generation feature without the OSS build carrying
  any of the enterprise logic.
- **Knowledge proto dual-field enums** — additive, deprecation-friendly
  replacements for the legacy string-encoded enum fields. GraphQL
  deprecations flag the old names.
- **Article addendum infrastructure** for benchmark write-ups, including
  a top-5 sweep across `learning_path` / `code_tour` / `workflow_story`
  and a parallel other-artifacts harness for slow local models.

### Fixed

- **Worker CI and release pipeline** — mypy debt cleared, Go data races
  fixed, Python lint clean, unused code removed.
- **Hallucination scorer** — no more trailing-slash false positives on
  path citations.
- **Workflow story generation** — raised `max_tokens` to match DEEP
  artifacts elsewhere so long walks don't truncate.
- **Path filter** accepts known-directory citations (previously rejected
  directory-only paths as hallucinations).
- **Shared knowledge parsing helpers** promoted to a reusable module so
  each generator doesn't reinvent the same regex dance.

### Changed

- **Frontend auth fetch paths consolidated** — all API calls now go
  through one helper with consistent header handling and error
  classification.
- **Error handling and shutdown paths tightened** — graceful drains,
  fewer leaked goroutines, cleaner logs.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-16

**Telemetry, Docker Hub, and community infrastructure.**

### Added

- **Anonymous install telemetry** from the Go API to
  `https://telemetry.sourcebridge.ai/v1/ping`. Opt-out respected; provider
  kind and version reported. Minimal dashboard for the maintainers to
  understand deployment spread.
- **Docker Hub distribution** — `docker compose up -d` with the official
  `sourcebridge/sourcebridge-api` image is now the recommended quickstart.
- **Community files** — `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant),
  `SECURITY.md`, CI lint fixes, standardized issue templates.
- **Fast / Deep repo QA modes** — the CLI and REPL `ask` command now
  exposes two grounding profiles so casual queries don't pay for full
  repo context unnecessarily.

### Fixed

- CLI `ask` grounding quality — better evidence selection, fewer
  hallucinations, clearer error surfaces.
- Local compose and CLI AI paths — several configuration mismatches
  between `dev` and `compose` environments.
- Telemetry version reporting previously stamped "dev" even on tagged
  builds.

### Changed

- Removed the hosted telemetry service from the OSS repo (it lives in
  its own collector repo now, so this repo has no server code it
  shouldn't).
- Benchmark and demo seed data excluded from the OSS distribution to
  keep the repo lean.

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-14

**First-run demo experience.**

### Added

- **`./demo.sh`** — one command that starts SourceBridge, indexes a
  44-file sample `acme-api` TypeScript project, and generates cliff
  notes, code tours, and architecture diagrams. Drops new users directly
  into a fully-populated workspace without a long cold index.
- **Going-to-production guide** in `docs/` with backup / restore,
  capacity planning, and hardening checklists.
- **Screenshots in README** — overview, cliff notes, search, generation
  queue — so people can see what SourceBridge does before installing.

### Fixed

- **OSS worker logging** — job lifecycle events now emit correctly with
  the expected structure.
- **Worker Surreal fallback** — handles the "DB not reachable at startup"
  case without panic.
- **Viewport layout** — page-level scroll removed when the shell grid is
  active; the sidebar and main column now scroll independently. No more
  double scrollbars.

---

## [0.4.2] — 2026-04-13

Minor follow-up to 0.4.1 with a handful of persistence fixes.

### Added

- **Saved generation-mode overrides** per scope, so a repo set to DEEP
  for cliff notes doesn't forget across restarts.
- **Repeatable generation-mode benchmark harness** for regression
  testing model swaps.

### Fixed

- Generation-mode persistence race on rapid scope switches.
- Benchmark hardening: flake-free sampling, consistent seeding, fair
  provider comparisons.

---

## [0.4.1] — 2026-04-13

**Knowledge generation reliability + queue visibility.**

### Added

- **Prioritized refinement and generation-mode controls** — the queue
  now favors interactive work over maintenance sweeps; repo-level
  reindex no longer starves user-triggered cliff notes.
- **Monitor rollup for reused summaries** — aggregate cache-reuse stats
  surface on the Admin Monitor page so operators see how much work is
  served from the summary cache vs. regenerated.
- **Cache-reuse stats as first-class job fields** (leafHits, fileHits,
  packageHits, rootHits). Previously buried in message strings; now
  queryable via GraphQL and visible on every job card.
- **Knowledge timeouts driven by app config** — operators can tune the
  per-scope ceilings without recompiling.

### Fixed

- **Summary-node cache writes** — race between writers caused the cache
  to silently drop hot entries under load.
- **Queued knowledge jobs heartbeat** behind slot gates so the reaper
  doesn't mark legitimately-waiting jobs as stale.
- **Noisy repo segmentation** — the monitor's health signals got
  confused when a single repo had hundreds of sibling scopes. Segmented
  so each repo gets its own bucket.

### Changed

- **Understanding-first artifact rendering** — the field guide view
  now leads with the repository-understanding score and derived
  recommendations rather than a flat list of generated artifacts.
- **Vector-based logo** across all assets (dashboard, README, docs).

---

## [0.4.0-pre-report-pipeline] — 2026-04-10

Preview checkpoint for the reports feature-flag work. Not a normal release.

### Added

- Reports feature plan committed to `thoughts/` — professional
  multi-repo report generation, audience targeting, evidence system,
  appendices, level-of-effort estimation, PDF rendering. No runtime
  behavior yet; this tag marks the start of the implementation arc.

---

## [0.3.1] — 2026-04-10

### Changed

- **Reports feature moved to enterprise-only.** OSS ships without the
  report-generation path; the enterprise build re-injects it via the
  `MCPToolExtender` / enterprise-routes hook.

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-10

**Comprehension engine polish and confidence honesty.**

### Added

- **Deep-mode cliff notes** use repo-level analysis when generating a
  scoped (file or symbol) cliff note — scoped output now has access to
  the full repo understanding, not just local evidence.
- **Deep-mode workflow stories** also inherit cliff-notes analysis, so
  walk-throughs cite the same evidence the summary cited.
- **Bulk repository import** — paste a list of URLs to import many
  repos in one go.

### Fixed

- **Test coverage 100% bug** — the understanding-score calc clamped
  coverage to 100% even when fewer tests existed than symbols.
- **Confidence rules for cliff notes** — summaries ARE direct evidence
  (they were being treated as derivative, inflating the confidence
  badge on citation-light repos).
- **Progress-bar advancement** during generation for every artifact
  type (several types had been stuck at 0% until completion).
- **Workflow story richness** — higher base confidence, fuller content
  blocks, fewer null-field crashes (`entry_points` null-safety, full
  tracebacks in error logs).
- **Render prompt rewrite** — richer output, fewer in-flight flickers
  when a job is mid-generation and another poll arrives.
- **Refresh buttons** for code tour / learning path actually call
  `refreshArtifact` (they were previously no-ops on the UI side).
- **Stale job reaper** also marks linked artifacts as failed, so a
  stuck job doesn't leave a zombie artifact that looks READY in the UI.
- **Null-safety** across artifact dict lookups (`.get(key, []) or []`
  pattern applied consistently).

### Changed

- **Understanding-score horizontal layout** — fits better on narrow
  repo-detail cards and reads left-to-right.

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-10

**Comprehension Engine + production hardening.**

This release absorbed two months of comprehension-engine work, the
multi-phase summary-tree rollout, and the initial production-grade
hardening pass (53 commits over the 0.1.0-alpha baseline).

### Added

- **Hierarchical summary tree** — leaf / file / package / root
  comprehension layers with per-level max-token budgets and evidence
  propagation.
- **Scoped field-guide generation** — cliff notes / learning paths /
  code tours / workflow stories at any scope (repo / file / symbol /
  requirement).
- **Generation mode picker** — Fast vs. Medium vs. Deep, per scope,
  with live token and latency estimates.
- **Admin Monitor page** with the LLM job queue, live generation
  progress, reuse stats, and a breaker for runaway providers.
- **Semantic search** against the repository graph, grounded in the
  indexed symbol vectors.

### Fixed

- Initial production-grade reliability pass: retries, context-cancel
  plumbing, bounded goroutines, graceful shutdown, breaker on
  consecutive compute failures.
- Null-safety, type-narrowing, and traceback surfacing across the
  worker's generation codepaths.

## [0.1.0-alpha] — 2026-04-03

**First public release.**

Initial alpha: repository indexing via tree-sitter, a gRPC worker with
Ollama / OpenAI / Anthropic LLM providers, a GraphQL API, a Next.js
web UI, and the bones of the cliff-notes generation pipeline. Enough
to demo; rough at the edges, with production hardening explicitly
deferred to 0.2.0.
